## ViCE: Villus and Crypt Evaluator
Intestinal villus and crypt morphology strongly correlate with nutrient absorption, intestinal disorder severity, and therapy response, so much so that abnormal morphology findings are central to disease diagnoses. Pathologists require ~30 min per patient when quantifying morphology data. Machine learning image analysis methods exist, but their reprodicibility and replicability can be unsatisfactory. We present a simple GUI that automatically evaluates tissue quality and determines quantitative histology measures. 

## Updates
* (06/2023) ViCE v.1.09.01 is released with its GUI
* (11/2022) ViCE v.0.14.03 is released. A more compact and functionalized iteration.
